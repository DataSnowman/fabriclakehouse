# Microsoft Fabric Fundamentals Workshop (fabriclakehouse)
Use this repo for learning and skilling related to Microsoft Fabric Fundamentals

Welcome to the workhop.  The purpose of the workshop is to bring you up to speed on some of the Lakehouse, Data Engineering, Data Science, and Data Analysis capabilities of Microsoft Fabric.  You will be using resources in a Microsoft Fabric tenant and in an Azure Subscription for this workshop.  As a result you could use this for training as an individual or group who have access to a Microsoft Fabric Workspace. Potentially if using other Azure services like Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure Databricks, Azure SQL Database, and Azure SQL Managed Instance you would also need an Azure Subscription.

The Workshop is broken into multiple parts by Fabric Analytic Workloads:
